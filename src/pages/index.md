Hi, I'm meizuflux. I'm a hobbyist programmer interested in backend web development, and a severe dislike for bloated and slow mobile and desktop apps.

I'm not a fan of frontend development, which is why this site looks the way it does. I prefer to spend my time doing better things than writing CSS.

Outside of programming, I'm interested in technology, online privacy, video games, and going to the movies. If any of those things sound interesting, feel free to contact me.
