## r2modman
The mod manager for ROUNDS. You can download it here: <https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus>.
Once installed, you can select ROUNDS as a game to mod and edit profiles / configurations.
You must launch from r2modman for mods to be enabled.

The Thunderstore App (Thunderstore is where most ROUNDS mods are hosted) is a reskinned version of r2modman that comes with ads. Just use r2modman.

## The Mods
### Essential
- [Tesseract by Sfinford](https://rounds.thunderstore.io/package/Sfinford/Tesseract/)
  - Modpack that adds patches, bugfixes, customization, and extra multiplayer functionality.
  - Personal favorite addition is **Pick\_N\_Cards** which allows you to pick multiple cards a turn and pick from more than 5.
- [CatInfo by CatsArmy](https://rounds.thunderstore.io/package/CatsArmy/CatInfo/)
  - This allows you to show your current stats and game information when pressing Tab, like the amount of damage or HP you have.

### Optional
- [CR by XAngelMoonX](https://rounds.thunderstore.io/package/XAngelMoonX/CR/)
  - After a while the base game cards get a bit boring, this mod adds over 100 cards to spice things up a bit.

If I install any more mods in the future I'll add them here.
